    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "- A function which gives value of probability for particular datapoint (x) is probability funciton basically.\n",
    "if it is derived for discrete random variable then it is probability mass function(pmf) and if it is derived for continuos random\n",
    "variable it is probability density function(pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",
    "pmf - what is probability of getting 1 if dice is thrown having sample space {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "pdf - what is probability that IQ of specific indian state falls between [85-100]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cumulative density function is summation of probability at each increasing point. its range is simply (0,1)\n",
    "it is used when we have see probability till specific set of datapoints not only one single datapoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model?\n",
    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution can be used as model for analyzing data of Intelligent-Quotient of India/specific country\n",
    "Or for test scores , or mostly for Quality control\n",
    "\n",
    "As from empirical rule of normal distribution,\n",
    "mean=mode=median is at center \n",
    "and 50 % of area is distributed in both of sections...\n",
    "as standard deviation moves towards right data distribution goes on decreasing on both directions...\n",
    "so thats why it becomes bell-shaped..\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal\n",
    "Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution is a ideal and best distribution for any dataset..\n",
    "So, it sets a reference for any data where it should go...\n",
    "that is the most important aspect of normal distribution...\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli distribution is special case of binomial distribution when n = 1.\n",
    "it is also used to calculate probabilities of events which are independent \n",
    "\n",
    "suppose we have to calculate probability of getting 1 head in one toss if P(H) = 0.8 and obviously P(T) = 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset\n",
    "is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater\n",
    "than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "so lets calculate Z-score for 60 \n",
    "it will be (xi - mean)/s.d = (60-50)/10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "z- score = 1\n",
    "so, after checking in Z-table area below standard normal 1 is almost 84%\n",
    "So Probability that any selected random variable is greater than 60 will be 100% - 84% = \"16%\" or 0.16\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform distribution is a termed to be rectangular distribution also...\n",
    "its pdf is 1/(b-a) and pmf is 1/n where n = b-a+1\n",
    "\n",
    "if a and b are min and max of datapoints then probability for each data point between a and b or in interval [a,b] is \n",
    "1/b-a\n",
    "\n",
    "one simple example of discrete uniform distribution is\n",
    "tossing a dice = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "min = 1 max = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "probability = 1/6-1+1 = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score is used to convert Normal distribution into standard normal distribution.\n",
    "It simply shifts normal distribution with any mean X on origin...and it becomes easier for probability calculation purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "if we take n samples from normal distribution and for each sample we calculated a mean like x1 , x2 , x3, ,....xn\n",
    "\n",
    "and we plotted those n sample means on graph then it will again form a normal distribution with mean almost equal to population\n",
    "data and standrad deviation = sigma/root(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "this is the concept of central limit theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "incase of non-gaussian distributions if sample size n >= 30 then Central limit theorem is applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "ndependence: The random variables in the sample must be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation does not influence the outcome of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identically Distributed: Each random variable in the sample must be drawn from the same probability distribution. This ensures that they have the same mean (\n",
    "�\n",
    "μ) and variance (\n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "σ \n",
    "2\n",
    " ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Variance: The random variables must have finite variances. This assumption ensures that the sample mean or sum will also have a finite variance, which is necessary for the convergence described by the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Sample Size: The Central Limit Theorem applies as the sample size (\n",
    "�\n",
    "n) becomes sufficiently large. While there is no fixed threshold for what constitutes a \"large\" sample size, a common rule of thumb is that the sample size should be greater than 30. However, even for smaller sample sizes, the CLT can often provide reasonable approximations if the underlying population distribution is not heavily skewed or has significant outliers.\n",
