    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file releases system resources associated with it, such as file descriptors. Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks, which may eventually cause your program to run out of available resources (such as open file descriptors), especially when dealing with a large number of files.\n",
    "Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write data to a file, the data may not be immediately flushed to the disk. Instead, it may be buffered in memory for performance reasons. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is flushed to disk, thus ensuring that all data is written properly and no data is lost.\n",
    "Concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, failing to close a file can prevent other processes or threads from accessing it. Closing the file releases locks and allows other processes to access it.\n",
    "Platform Independence:\n",
    "\n",
    "While many operating systems automatically close files when a program terminates, relying on this behavior can lead to unpredictable results, especially if your code is run on different platforms. Explicitly closing files ensures consistent behavior across different platforms.\n",
    "File Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some file systems may not update file metadata (such as access time or file size) until the file is closed. Closing the file ensures that any metadata updates are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then\n",
    "close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a text file and writing content into it\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reopening the file to read its content\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(\"Content of the file:\")\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "read():\n",
    "The read() method reads the entire contents of the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "If you don't specify a size argument, it will read the entire file.\n",
    "If you specify a size argument, it will read that many characters from the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Example using read()\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "readline():\n",
    "The readline() method reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "Each time you call readline(), it will read the next line from the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Example using readline()\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "    line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(\"Line 1:\", line1)\n",
    "    print(\"Line 2:\", line2)\n",
    "readlines():\n",
    "The readlines() method reads all lines of a file and returns a list where each element in the list represents a line from the file.\n",
    "You can iterate over this list to process each line individually.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Example using readlines()\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    for line in lines:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "In each example, replace \"example.txt\" with the path to your file. These methods provide different ways to read data from files in Python, allowing you to choose the most appropriate method based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement in Python is used in conjunction with the open() function to manage the opening and closing of files. The advantage of using the with statement with open() is primarily for resource management, specifically ensuring that files are properly closed after they are no longer needed. Here's why the with statement is used with open() and its advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Resource Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code inside it is executed, even if an exception occurs within that block.\n",
    "It automatically calls the close() method on the file object when the block exits, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that system resources (such as file descriptors) are released promptly.\n",
    "Cleaner Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the with statement makes the code cleaner and more concise by encapsulating the resource management logic within a single block.\n",
    "It eliminates the need for explicit calls to close() and reduces the chance of forgetting to close the file.\n",
    "Improved Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement clearly indicates the scope in which the file is being used, improving code readability and making it easier to understand the purpose of the code.\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to automatically closing the file, the with statement can also handle exceptions raised within the block, allowing for better error handling and recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "write():\n",
    "The write() method is used to write a string to a file.\n",
    "It takes a single argument, which is the string to be written to the file.\n",
    "If the file is opened in text mode ('t'), the argument must be a string. If the file is opened in binary mode ('b'), the argument must be a bytes-like object.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Example using write()\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is a line of text.\\n\")\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is another line of text.\\n\")\n",
    "writelines():\n",
    "The writelines() method is used to write a sequence of strings to a file.\n",
    "It takes an iterable (such as a list) containing strings as its argument.\n",
    "Each string in the iterable is written to the file without adding any line separators.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Example using writelines()\n",
    "lines = [\"Line 1\\n\", \"Line 2\\n\", \"Line 3\\n\"]\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "In both examples, a file named \"example.txt\" is opened in write mode (\"w\"). The write() and writelines() methods are then used to write data to the file. After the block of code inside the with statement exits, the file is automatically closed.\n",
